This is the first application I wrote and published to the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fiber-counter/id1616530799). It was purely a learning exercise to follow an idea through from start to navigating App Store review. Undoubtedly, the most interesting part of this early project was the fact that I had to dip into UIViewControllerRepresentable in order to support emailing functionality that I wanted.

```Swift
struct MailView: UIViewControllerRepresentable {
  @Environment(\.presentationMode) var presentation
  @Binding var data: ComposeMailData
  let callback: MailViewCallback

  class Coordinator: NSObject, MFMailComposeViewControllerDelegate {
    @Binding var presentation: PresentationMode
    @Binding var data: ComposeMailData
    let callback: MailViewCallback

    init(presentation: Binding<PresentationMode>,
         data: Binding<ComposeMailData>,
         callback: MailViewCallback) {
      _presentation = presentation
      _data = data
      self.callback = callback
    }

    func mailComposeController(_ controller: MFMailComposeViewController,
                               didFinishWith result: MFMailComposeResult,
                               error: Error?) {
      if let error = error {
        callback?(.failure(error))
      } else {
        callback?(.success(result))
      }
      $presentation.wrappedValue.dismiss()
    }
  }

  func makeCoordinator() -> Coordinator {
    Coordinator(presentation: presentation, data: $data, callback: callback)
  }

  func makeUIViewController(context: UIViewControllerRepresentableContext<MailView>) -> MFMailComposeViewController {
    let vc = MFMailComposeViewController()
    vc.mailComposeDelegate = context.coordinator
    vc.setSubject(data.subject)
    vc.setToRecipients(data.recipients)
    vc.setMessageBody(data.message, isHTML: false)
    data.attachments?.forEach {
      vc.addAttachmentData($0.data, mimeType: $0.mimeType, fileName: $0.fileName)
    }
    vc.accessibilityElementDidLoseFocus()
    return vc
  }

  func updateUIViewController(_ uiViewController: MFMailComposeViewController,
                              context: UIViewControllerRepresentableContext<MailView>) {
  }

  static var canSendMail: Bool {
    MFMailComposeViewController.canSendMail()
  }
}
```

What is this a nice thing to do to myself as a new Swift and SwiftUI developer? No.  
Did I get the emailing functionality working? Yes.
